# Bdev.ai - Empowering B2B business development teams with our AI.

*“The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but building on the new.“

Our team has created a chrome extension specifically designed for sales teams at B2B SaaS companies to help them secure leads faster by creating genuine relationships with these leads.

bdev.ai is built on top of the OpenAI API, which provides us with powerful artificial intelligence capabilities. We use this API to gather insights on businesses, interests, and pain points for our leads, allowing sales teams to craft targeted pitches that speak directly to their needs and goals.

In addition to the OpenAI API, bdev.ai is also a chrome extension. This allows our tool to be easily accessible from within the Chrome browser, making it convenient for sales teams to use while they work.

We hope that this technical documentation gives you a better understanding of the technologies and tools that went into building bdev.ai. If you have any questions or would like to contribute to the development of our tool, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
