For the longest time in history, the flow of sales have been the same. With the rise of Bladerunner team, we are restoring the fun and adventures back into the sales process--invigorating a high morale within sales teams all around the world working in the B2B SaaS vertical!

During the HF0 AI Hack Week, our team has created a chrome extension specifically designed for sales teams at B2B SaaS companies to help them secure leads faster by creating genuine relationships with these leads. Bdev.ai is built on top of the OpenAI API. With careful prompt engineering, we have been able to fine tune our model so that it produces output that matches our B2B clients' expectatons on the kind of hyper-personalized outreach message that they would like to use on LinkedIn.

We are continuing our journey in Bdev.ai by creating our own AI API that integrates with our clients' CRM data to gather further insights on the interests and pain points of their lead accounts. Such integration allows our Generative AI to craft targeted pitches that speak directly to their needs and goals. We fine tune our model by also providing a feedback loop for every message generated through our interface.

Our Chrome extension is easily accessible from within the Chrome browser, making it convenient for sales teams to use while they work. That said, our live demo can be accessed through the links above.

For your reference, we have created this technical documentation to give you a better understanding of the technologies and tools that used into building bdev.ai. If you have any questions or would like to contribute to the development of our tool, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at hello@bdev.ai.

# Founder's Story:

As a founder and CEO, I know firsthand the challenges and sacrifices that come with building a company from the ground up. In 2019, the toll of long hours and hard work caught up with me, and I found myself hospitalized for a month with borderline-autoimmune symptoms. It was a wake-up call, and I knew I had to make some major changes to my life and work habits.

I began prioritizing self-care and wellness, and as a result, I was able to fully recover and get back to my passion for building innovative companies. It was during this time that I realized the vast potential of artificial intelligence to streamline and automate many of the tasks that entrepreneurs like myself often spend countless hours on.

That's why I founded bdev.ai - to harness the power of AI and bring a new level of efficiency and personalization to the process of business development. By leveraging advanced technologies like ChatGPT and GPT-3.5 API, I was able to create a tool that could handle much of the outreach and communication with leads, leaving me free to focus on the big picture and ensure that the AI was producing top-quality results.

After years of working on various projects such as web3 games, ecommerce websites, and mobile apps, I am proud to say that bdev.ai is the product I am most proud of. It has allowed me to do what I love most - building and growing my business - without getting bogged down in the tedious, time-consuming tasks that often distract from the bigger picture. With bdev.ai, I can focus on what really matters - taking my company to new heights and helping other founders and entrepreneurs do the same.
