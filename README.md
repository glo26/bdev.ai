For the longest time in history, the flow of sales have been the same. With the rise of Bladerunner team, we are restoring the fun and adventures back into the sales process--invigorating a high morale within sales teams all around the world working in the B2B SaaS vertical!

During the HF0 AI Hack Week, our team has created a chrome extension specifically designed for sales teams at B2B SaaS companies to help them secure leads faster by creating genuine relationships with these leads. Bdev.ai is built on top of the OpenAI API. With careful prompt engineering, we have been able to fine tune our model so that it produces output that matches our B2B clients' expectatons on the kind of hyper-personalized outreach message that they would like to use on LinkedIn.

We are continuing our journey in Bdev.ai by creating our own AI API that integrates with our clients' CRM data to gather further insights on the interests and pain points of their lead accounts. Such integration allows our Generative AI to craft targeted pitches that speak directly to their needs and goals. We continue to fine tune our model by also providing a feedback loop for every message generated through our interface.

Our Chrome extension is easily accessible from within the Chrome browser, making it convenient for sales teams to use while they work. That said, our live demo can be accessed through the links above.

For your reference, we have created this technical documentation to give you a better understanding of the technologies and tools that used into building bdev.ai. If you have any questions or would like to contribute to the development of our tool, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at hello@bdev.ai.

# Founder's Note:

My world came crushing down from working too hard. Towards the end of 2019, I was hospitalized for 1 month. I was quarantined before everyone else was starting in 2020. They said I was having borderline-autoimmune symptoms, so I had a chance to reverse my life around. So, I did, I started eating well, sleeping enough, and exercising more often. Slowly, my condition became better and better to the point of where I am today.

Now, I realized that I was doing the right thing the wrong way. 80% of our work today could be fully automated by AI. Say, we work 20-30 hours building the tool that will ultimately perform hundreds of hours into the future.

This is why I created bdev.ai. After doing business development for my own digital software agency for 5 years, I realized that now with the power of ChatGPT and GPT-3.5 API, I could automate most of my workflow.

So, this is what I have built over the weekend. I recoded the entire interface that allows for more careful prompting of the model and was able to provide context for the AI to perform a highly personalized messages for each lead sitting in the company’s CRM.

I’m happy to say that after shipping many things in the past, such as web3 game on Polygon, ecommerce websites, and mobile apps, this is the one I am most proud of, because now I don’t have to do 80% of my business development outreach manually. All I have to do is to monitor the performance of the AI, check the quality of the messages that they produce, and click send!
